// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
  * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
  * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
  * The last parameter accepts a callback
  * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
*/

function consume(a, b, cb) {
  return cb(a, b);
}

/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function greeting(firstName, lastName) {
  return `Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}, nice to meet you!`;
}

/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!

// ==== Closures ==== 

// Explain in your own words why nestedfunction can access the variable internal.

// Explanation: The nested function scope is inside the enclosed function (the called function). It is invisible outside the function scope and cannot be called outside of it, but it can see and access local objects outside the function. Like somebody in a car with tinted windows. You can see out but they cannot see you in the car. 


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
